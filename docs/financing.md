# Phase 2.2g): Financing Requirements

## Initial Development Costs
Based on the budget and team structure, the investment would be **"Sweat Equity"** where capital is contributed in the form of unpaid work time.

--- **Effort Calculation:** ---  
3 developers × 20 hours/week × 6 weeks (Sprints) = **360 total hours**.  

--- **Monetary Valuation:** ---  
360 hours × €20/hour = **€7,200**.  

--- **Feasibility Analysis:** ---  
    **Can it be done without external financing?** Yes. Since it's an "indie hacker" venture, it doesn't require cash flow but rather invested time.

## Infrastructure and Services Costs
Priority is given to free services to start.

| Concept | Selected Service | Monthly Cost (Est.) | Annual Cost (Est.) | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **Hosting** | Digital Ocean | €12 | €144 | For MVP React. |
| **Database** | MongoDB local | €0 | €0 | Free. |
| **Domain** | name.com | - | €38.99 | `tabletopmastering.games`. |
| **External API** | BoardGameGeek API | €0 | €0 | Free XML API. |
| **Storage** | Digital Ocean | €0 | €0 | For avatars and images. |
| **Monitoring** | Digital Ocean | €0 | €0 | Basic downtime and error monitoring. |
| **TOTAL** | | **~€12 / month** | **~€183 / year** | |

## Marketing and Launch Costs
Since the target audience is tabletop gamers with a specific niche, it's not advisable to invest excessively.

The strategy will be **Content Marketing and Community** such as Reddit, BGG forums, Discord, Instagram.

**Design Tools:** €0 (Figma free version).

## Working Capital
Fixed costs are minimal as a small project, and as long as team members contribute work, it can continue operating.

- **Burn Rate (Monthly Spending):** ~€7 in infrastructure.
- **6-Month Emergency Fund:** 7 € x 6 = **€42**.
- **Contingency Buffer:** €100.

## Funding Sources

According to our "Indie Hacker" profile and competition:

--- **Bootstrapping:** ---    
Founders cover minimum costs. Allows maintaining 100% control and equity.

--- **Patreon:** ---  
Ideal for covering server costs through community micro-patronage.

--- **Public Grants:** ---    
Websites like invbit.com offer aid up to €29,000 in digital kit form. Subsidies that can give our project a boost.

--- **Business Angels:** ---  
The project doesn't seek hyper-growth demanded by venture investors. Plus, it would dilute the ownership of the 3 founders.

--- **Crowdfunding:** ---  
Requires a strong marketing campaign and a finished product. May be premature for an incomplete MVP. Alternative to banks.

### Financing Sources Comparison

| Source             | Advantages                                                   | Disadvantages                                                |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Bootstrapping      | Full control, no debt or ownership dilution                  | Limited by own resources, slower growth                       |
| Patreon            | Direct community support, recurring income                   | Low income initially, requires active community              |
| Public Grants      | No repayment required, no ownership dilution                 | Bureaucratic processing, competitive access                 |
| Business Angels    | Provide capital and expertise, accelerate growth             | Ownership dilution, pressure for results and scalability     |
| Crowdfunding       | Visibility, market validation, fast capital access          | Requires strong campaign, platform fees, uncertain success   |

#### Usage Recommendations by Project Type

- **Bootstrapping:** Recommended for small projects with low costs and teams preferring full control. Ideal in initial phases and to validate the product without external pressure.
- **Patreon:** Useful when a community already exists and you want to cover minimum recurring costs. Ideal for projects with loyal users and regular content.
- **Public Grants:** Highly recommended for startups and microenterprises meeting grant requirements. Especially useful for financing without diluting ownership or taking on debt.
- **Business Angels:** Appropriate when needing to scale fast, access networks and expertise, and willing to give up part of the company. Better for high-growth potential projects.
- **Crowdfunding:** Recommended if the product is near its final version and a strong marketing campaign can be mobilized. Useful for market validation and fast capital, though with risk of not reaching the target.

## Proposed Financing Plan

**How much capital would you need to raise?**  
Always the maximum we can access, but with a digital kit bonus of €2000 for a microenterprise of 0-3 employees it's sufficient.

#### Estimated Capital Distribution

| Concept          | Percentage (%) | Estimated Amount (€) |
|------------------|:--------------:|:--------------------:|
| Development      | 40%            | 800                  |
| Infrastructure   | 35%            | 700                  |
| Marketing        | 20%            | 400                  |
| Reserve Fund     | 5%             | 100                  |

*Total capital requested: €2,000*


**What financing source is most appropriate for your project?**  
Public grants such as the digital kit since they don't require repayment, ceding part of the company, and will be processed through Invbit itself.

**What would you invest it in? (development, marketing, infrastructure, etc.)**
In infrastructure to develop the App's Landing Page and maintain hosting.  
Also in marketing by reducing the workload of founding team members.
